For customizing the image create the patch files of u-boot and kernel-configuration.

For u-boot add the patch file contents in the below files:
fsl-community-bsp-jethro-customization/sources/meta-custom/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-fslc-custom/u-boot-custom-sd-card.patch
fsl-community-bsp-jethro-customization/sources/meta-custom/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-fslc-custom/u-boot-custom-emmc.patch

For kernel-configuration add the patch file contents in the below file:
fsl-community-bsp-jethro-customization/sources/meta-custom/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-fslc-imx-custom/kernel-custom_2019_10.patch

Then, first run the file:
source setup-environment build

If permission denied, then run the below command and again run the above command:
chmod a+wrx -R path_of_the_folder/sources

Then, compile and deploy the u-boot by the below commands:
bitbake -c compile -f u-boot-fslc-custom   //compile u-boot

bitbake -c deploy u-boot-fslc-custom   //deploy u-boot

Then, compile and deploy the kernel-configuration by the below commands:
bitbake -c compile -f linux-fslc-imx-custom   //compile kernel

bitbake -c deploy linux-fslc-imx-custom   //deploy kernel

Then, finally create the image by below command:
For SD-CARD:
Note: MACHINE=imx6qcustom (in local.conf)
bitbake custom-image

For EMMC:
Note: MACHINE=imx6qcustom-emmc (in local.conf)
bitbake emmc-custom-image

To flash the image:
In SD-CARD
sudo dd bs=4M if=custom-image of=/dev/sdx

In EMMC:
sudo dd bs=4M if=emmc-custom-image of=/dev/sdx
