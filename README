For customizing the image create the patch files of u-boot and kernel-configuration.
source/meta-

Then, first run the file:
source setup-environment build

Then, compile and deploy the u-boot by the below commands:
bitbake -c compile -f u-boot-fslc-custom   //compile u-boot

bitbake -c deploy u-boot-fslc-custom   //deploy u-boot

Then, compile and deploy the kernel-configuration by the below commands:
bitbake -c compile -f linux-fslc-imx-custom   //compile kernel

bitbake -c deploy linux-fslc-imx-custom   //deploy kernel

Then, finally create the image by below command:
For SD-CARD:
Note: MACHINE=imx6qcustom (in local.conf)
bitbake custom-image

For EMMC:
Note: MACHINE=imx6qcustom-emmc (in local.conf)
bitbake emmc-custom-image

To flash the image:
In SD-CARD
sudo dd bs=4M if=custom-image of=/dev/sdx

In EMMC:
sudo dd bs=4M if=emmc-custom-image of=/dev/sdx
